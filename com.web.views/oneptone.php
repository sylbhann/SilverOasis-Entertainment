                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Spriggan city of the Enari, is the greatest of the Spriggan achievements since the dawning days of their ancient days. Within the surroundings of the large oak, the Spriggan kingdom lies as a symbol of peace and greatness. It is also a city hidden within the forests, protecting those who would seek no destruction. Anubhain is carved delicately from the lone tree, each minuscule detail wrought from love and gentle caution by each and every Enari who once lived their many ages ago. Anubhain’s creation is one out of love and hard-work.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Spriggan spared no detail in their design, by having their history categorized into events, marking each year of each month of their existence. The carvings seem like water that has passed between the sides and inner veins to create a colorful masterpiece. When evening grows and the suns orange blanket filters slowly out of the forest, Anubhain lights up with a soft blue hue. The Spriggan have designed stones that have been imbued with powerful magical artifacts that, when the sun blinks, and the moon pops, the “Moon Stones” sparkle. Strategically, the Spriggans have placed the stones carefully around Anubhain, even so far as to add them to their historical carvings and patterns</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Within Anubhain itself, the floors have all been designed with strain to map out rooms and hallways that will house Spriggan for thousands of years. The great city has many floors for living, eating, and entertaining. The grand archway opening to the main floors, are intricately entwined as if the vines themselves curved around each others loving embrace to create the entrance within. Upon entering the Spriggan hold, a domed ceiling reaching many lengths high - is the central hub of the city.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The great dome connects to passages leading to the north, south, west and east. These are the main districts carved around the greatest roots of Anubhain. The Spriggans attention to detail spares no disinterest to the “tall ones,” for those elves or humans that do visit, between the outer-ward roots in the southern grounds.</p>
