                            We are SilverOasis, 3D Development. We make games for fun and hope to make this into one of the 
                            big AAA game companies out there. Of course, we know and understand that this takes time. It 
                            also takes funding. Since we can’t afford to support the UDK from small sales, we will have to 
                            live off of your gracious donations. If you should feel so inclined as to donate, we would love 
                            the help and support. Of course, no matter what, we won’t be discouraged and still make whatever 
                            games we can.

                            Originally founded by Sterling and Christian Grant, cousins, we had our own ideas of what 
                            SilverOasis should be. In the course of 10 years, it’s been several different faces but we’ve had 
                            thoughts. Good thoughts. Great thoughts. The thoughts that not only make you think of tropical 
                            pom poms and white sandy beaches, but of having fun with computers! (But not the two together… I 
                            don’t fancy a short on my computer from ocean water….).
                            <br><br>
                            We are also seeking your help! As we are non-profit at this moment, you will need to provide 
                            free work. We are looking for:

                            Pro-Wonderful Digital Development and some people interested in RPG’s!
                            <br><br>
                            Being interested in games is a huge plus. (We hope!)
                            <br><br>
                            We also plan on making games with other folks around. There are some really awesome and talented 
                            people who are into character design and development. We will probably be working with these guys 
                            (and gals) to make games and get our name out there. During this process, we will always remember
                            how awesome you are in supporting us and our continued progress.
