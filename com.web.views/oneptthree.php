                                <p>(Unequipped Items, Maki Naturally) [Plants, grows, and harvests food] It takes a full day to grow food, and only a few seconds to harvest food. Maybe we can make it to where changing races takes a lot of stamina and energy, so she has to eat often if changes often. Lantern glows generic light if on.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><h4>Aredani Wings</h4>
                                <p>(Back) [Flight] Has a flight-meter, used to jump long distances and Maki’s outfit changes a little to have sporadic feathers. Or feathers on skin, like shoulders etc. Her clothes should also appear silky, and changed to white or a lighter shade of her basic model. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><h4>Lantern of the Eladani</h4>
                                <p>(Held item) [When held, Maki and lantern glow with Faelight] Passively on her belt loop and can be toggled on/off with generic light, but when held, turns Maki into a huge light, lighting caves, dark corners, etc. Whatever artifact is equipped at the time will make the lantern glow that color. Example: When the Aredani wings are equipped, lantern glows white. When the Shield or Jaedar is equipped, lantern glows light green.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><h4>Claws of the Assani</h4>
                                <p>(Gloves) [Digging] She can dig into the ground within 2-3 seconds and can’t be seen or reached. Intelligent enemies will wait, creatures will lose interest. Should have an air-meter, possible suffocation. Opens certain areas when in caves. When these claws are equipped, the lantern glows generic light if on.</p>
                            </li>
