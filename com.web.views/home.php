	<h3>SilverOasis Entertainment</h3>
	<div>
            <p>
                SilverOasis is about making quality, epic development games. It's 
                about the quality and love that we have for the games and their 
                genre's. SilverOasis is about you: for your suggestions, our 
                friends, family and followers. It's not just about what happens in 
                the game, it's the environment, it's about the atmosphere, but most 
                importantly: it's about the fun!
                <br><br>
                SilverOasis was formed in 1999 by Sterling and Christian Grant, 
                cousins, in a cause to form a nice personal website about the games 
                that we loved to play. Over the years, it has been a blog, forums, 
                flash website designing, HTML website development, storage and a 
                little bit of everything in-between.
