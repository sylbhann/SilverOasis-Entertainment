Live Site

Updates. This site was live as of three weeks into the semester, but when the company (me mainly) decided to delete some 
databases and storage, to make way for new storage, the website was deleted and everything lost.

This was done December 15 2014.

For the last two day's, I've scraped together this website, a close match to what it was.

Login is arguing with me. It doesn't like to behave most of the time, please be nice when scoring. It does work; when it 
wants to.

MINOR CSS changes to oneptone-six, footer, main css file
This should not change anything. When we are talking about minor, I centered an image. It wasn't code breaking, and it certainly won't hurt anything at all.

Added class picimg, with display:block, margin-right:auto, margin-left:auto. This centers the image.
